// 6: operators and keywords
// Defines valid name as custom operator/keyword for parsing
// The language is equipped with standard operators everyone can expect (arithmetic operators and other things)
// <operator|keyword> <name> as <binary|prefix|postfix> ( : <priority> )

operator ... as binary
keyword eat as prefix
{
	A: (a ... b) // ... [a, b],
	B: (eat shit) // eat [shit]
}

// Operators and keywords behave differently with compound expressions - in short, keywords require exact match, while operators do not.

{
	Operator: (amo...gus) // ... [amo, gus], despite the expression being one primitive, the ... is considered as an operator.
	Keyword: (great) // "great", the "eat" is not considered as a keyword.
}

// Complex names do not work

// operator "" as binary // nope
// operator "impostors among us" as postfix // nope


// 'priority' indicates which operators/keywords should be read first; which will determine the tree structure of the compiled operation.
// operators/keywords with lower priority gets parsed earlier, and results closer to root of the node because of that.
// operators/keywords with higher priority gets parsed later, and results closer to end side of the node.
// thus, on actual interpretation, operators/keywords with higher priority gets evaluated earlier;
// since you have to evaluate it from leaf to root (reverse order from compiling)

// note that multiple operators/keywords with same type can share same priority
// but not the ones with different types!

// default operator priorities:

// BINARY "=" : 0
// BINARY "||" : 1
// BINARY "&&" : 2
// BINARY "==" "!=" : 3
// BINARY ">" "<" ">=" "<=" : 4
// BINARY "|" "&" : 5
// BINARY "+" "-" : 6
// BINARY "*" "/" "%" : 7
// BINARY "^" "**" : 8
// BINARY Custom POSTFIX Custom : 9 (binary default)
// UNARY POSTFIX Custom : 10 (postfix default)
// UNARY PREFIX "!" "-" "+" "~" : 11 (prefix default)
// BINARY "." : 12
