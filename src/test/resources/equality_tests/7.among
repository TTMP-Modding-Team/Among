// 7: macro 2: the fucking assault of the edge cases
// So basically I just ran into the theoretical issue while writing snippet code for documentation
// lol

// As seen below, name of the collections can be modified
macro name=name(name=name): name [1, 2, 3]

name=name(awsdsf) // awsdsf [1, 2, 3]


// This code doesn't work, though. The compiler have no idea op is supposed to be a binary operator
/*
macro oper(a, b, op): (a op b) // Compilation error

(oper(1, 2, +) = 3) // User expects = [+ [1, 2], 3], gets slapped over
*/
// "correct" way to write it......
macro oper(a, b, op): op [ a, b ]

(oper(1, 2, "+") = 3) // = [+ [1, 2], 3]

// Also you cannot use parameters in keys

macro bullshit(key, value): { key: value }
bullshit(among, us) // User expects { among: us }, actual result is { key: us }
// Maybe it will be implemented in future?????? nah
