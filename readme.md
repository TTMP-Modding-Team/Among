# AMONG: Absolutely Mental Object Notation (G is silent (that's how acronyms work right?))

**Among** is JSON-inspired data expression format for general data structures. It is designed to be easy-to-write format for users, while preserving structural soundness and broad applicability of JSON.

The features of **Among** include...
* *Clean syntax* which eliminates most of redundant characters compared to JSON.
* *Macro* which makes data easier to view for humans and reduces repetition to minimum.
* *Operations*, new syntactic alternative for lists, and 100% user definable *operators* and *keywords* which gets parsed to syntax tree.
* And absolutely cringeworthy naming which will brighten your everyday life!
